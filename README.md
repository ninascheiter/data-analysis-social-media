# 📊 Social Media Interaction & Sentiment Analysis on Bluesky Data

## Overview
This project analyzes large-scale **social media data from Bluesky** to study user interactions and sentiment dynamics.  
The original dataset contains the **posting history of 4M+ users (≈81% of all accounts)** with **235M posts**.  
For this analysis, the data was pre-processed and aggregated into smaller, structured subsets to enable efficient exploration in **Jupyter Notebooks with Python, Pandas and Matplotlib**.

## 🎯 Goals
- Load, clean, and preprocess the datasets  
- Explore **user activity patterns** and **interaction behavior**  
- Perform **sentiment analysis** over time  
- Visualize engagement dynamics with Pandas/Matplotlib
